= Skillmaster API

== Summary

This is the API for the Skillmaster app. It's a pretty standard restful Rails 4 API.

== Getting started

All you need to do to start development is your usual Rails commandsâ€”`rails s` starts the server, and `rails c` opens the Rails console.

=== Auth

Skillmaster uses the Devise gem to handle auth. For now it is a pretty simple auth solution, but it's extensible should new features be desired later on (email verifications and so on).

=== Deployment

Pushing code to master on Github will automatically deploy a new build to the Heroku instance.
